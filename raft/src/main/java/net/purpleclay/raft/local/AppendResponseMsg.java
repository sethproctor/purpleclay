 * option is to return {@code false} and let the leader iterate backwards one
 * index at a time until an acceptible re-synchronization point is found. This
 * requires keeping extra state at the leader and can result in large numbers
 * of "catch-up" messages. As suggested by the RAFT authors, this message
 * implementation includes a best-guess by the follower at the index to try.
