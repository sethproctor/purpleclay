/**
 * Utility class for handling server membership changes. This class implements
 * {@code MembershipHandle} to provide access to the complete membership. It
 * also implements {@code StateMachine} so that membership changes can be
 * made via the distributed log. Typically, instances are used as the handle
 * for cluster membership and added as one of several state machines via a
 * utility like {@code DelegatingStateMachine} registered using the identifier
 * {@code COMMAND_ID}.
 * <p>
 * State changes can and will happen independently of when a cluster member
 * tries to join or leave. Because of this, the model supported is that once a
 * member is added via a {@code Command} created by {@code createAddCommand} it
 * stays in the membership until an associated {@code createRemoveCommand}
 * {@code Command} is sent. While a server is in the membership it will be
 * unavailable for any RPCs or Command-handling until some specific instance
 * of {@code Server} is registered. For instance, a common pattern is to
 * send the add membership command along with registering a {@code LocalServer}.
 * The ordering of these two operations is unimportant.
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation will call {@code start} on any registered
 * {@code Server} instance once it is associated with a valid member.
 * <p>
 * TODO: if there was some object that could be associated with each server
 * when added then it would be easy to advertise (and persist) things like
 * address or host name.
